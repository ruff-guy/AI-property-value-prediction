# AI-property-value-prediction
house price prediction( regression , XGboost)

Machine learning pipeline in Python to predict property values, leveraging a dataset of over 20,000 
housing records. Implemented and benchmarked multiple regression algorithms, progressing from a 
baseline Linear Regression model (R² of 0.60) to a high-performance XGBoost model, (R² of 0.83 ) 
boosting predictive accuracy by over 20%. Reduced Mean Squared Error from 0.5559 to 0.2273. 
Serialized the final, optimized XGBoost model using Joblib, preparing it for deployment in a production
like environment or API.
